Steps of what the engine does:
1. Instantiate Window object
    - initializes GLFW (GLFramework)
    - initializes GLEW (GL Extension Wrangler)
    - set event handlers (mouse/key/resize)
2. Initialize IMGUI
3. Register tests using 'test' class
    - the game loop with run one instance of a test at a time
    - tests can be switched during run-time
    - tests have methods to update and render
4. Main game loop

Main game loop:
1. Update delta time
2. Call 'update' method of current test
3. Call 'render' method of current test
4. Imgui::begin()
5. Call 'imguirender' method of current test
6. Imgui::end()
7. Imgui::render()
8. glfw pollevents, swapbuffer 

Testfps class:
    Held objects:
        Window reference
        Camera instance

        /* Environment */
        Shader unique_ptr
        Material instance
        Mesh unique_ptr
        Texture vector<unique_ptr>
        Mesh::Vertex vector of instance
        unsigned int vector

        /* Ground */
        Texture instance * 4
        Shader unique_ptr
        Material instance
        Mesh unique_ptr
        Mesh::Vertex vector of instances
        unsigned int vector

        /* LightSource */
        { /* these three makes up a Mesh */
            VertexArray unique_ptr
            VertexBuffer unique_ptr
            IndexBuffer unique_ptr
        }
        Shader unique_ptr
        LightSource instance * 2

        /* other */
        float - deltaTime
        float - moveSpeed
        Matrix - View
        Matrix - Proj
        Camera::cameraModeType - cameraMode

Mesh class:
    Held objects:
        vector<Vertex> reference
        vector<unsigned int> reference
        Material reference
        VertexArray unique_ptr
        VertexBuffer unique_ptr
        IndexBuffer unique_ptr

Observations:
Currently there are two environment objects:
Light object
    - three types currently: point, directional, spot
Material object
    - each material has ambient/diffuse/specular/emission textures,
        which describe how light affects them
    - each material has a shininess factor
